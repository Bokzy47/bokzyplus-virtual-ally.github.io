    <h1>About Bokzy+ Virtual Ally</h1>

    <p>
      I am a Transaction Coordinator and Operations Virtual Assistant supporting
      real estate professionals, teams, and growing businesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work focuses on keeping transactions organized, compliant, and moving
      forward smoothly—from contract to close—while supporting day-to-day
      operations behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am detail-oriented, reliable, and proactive, with a strong focus on
      communication, accuracy, and meeting deadlines. My goal is to reduce
      operational stress so clients can focus on growth and client relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether supporting a single agent, a real estate team, or a business
      operation, I bring structure, consistency, and accountability to every
      workflow.
