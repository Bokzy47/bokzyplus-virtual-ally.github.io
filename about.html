  <!-- INTRO / BRAND STORY -->
  <section class="section section-soft">
    <div class="card">
      <p class="lead-text">
        Bokzy+ Virtual Productivity Ally was created to support professionals who
        need structure, reliability, and follow-through behind the scenes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work I do focuses on the details that keep operations moving:
        deadlines, documents, systems, and communication. My role is to remove
        friction so agents, founders, and teams can stay focused on high-value work.

  <!-- WHY BOKZY+ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="section-title">Why Bokzy+</h3>
      <p>
        Many professionals struggle not because they lack skill, but because their
        backend processes are disorganized, reactive, or undocumented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bokzy+ exists to bring order to that space. I support transactions and
        operations with a systems mindset—clear workflows, clean files, and
        proactive execution—so nothing important is left to chance.

        <li>Consistency matters more than speed</li>
